# Demo Audio Files

This directory should contain the following audio files for the landing page demo:

1. `landing-demo.mp3` - Original mixed audio track (vocals + instrumental)
2. `landing-demo-vocals.mp3` - Isolated vocals track
3. `landing-demo-instrumental.mp3` - Isolated instrumental track

## How to add your own demo files:

1. Choose a royalty-free music track (30-60 seconds recommended)
2. Use an audio separation tool to create vocals and instrumental versions
3. Export all three files as MP3 format
4. Place them in this directory with the exact filenames above
5. Make sure the files are optimized (stereo, 44.1kHz, 192kbps or higher)

## Temporary Placeholder:

Until you add your own files, the component will show an error message.
For testing, you can use any short audio clip and duplicate it as vocals/instrumental.

## File Size Recommendations:

- Keep each file under 5MB for fast page load
- Use MP3 format for best browser compatibility
- 30-60 seconds duration is ideal for demo
