   - Channels: Stereo
   - Duration: 2-8 seconds
   - File Size: Under 2MB

2. **Replace the file**:

   ```

3. **Test it**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000 and navigate to demo section
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Convert Your File

Don't have the right format? Use FFmpeg:

```

## âœ… Verify Format

```bash
file public/assets/loops/dry.wav

```
