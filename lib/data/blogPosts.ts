    excerpt: 'Understanding the psychology and patterns behind content that spreads like wildfire.',
    content: `What makes content go viral? While there's no guaranteed formula, certain patterns emerge consistently.

Emotional resonance is crucial. Content that evokes strong emotions—whether joy, surprise, or inspiration—is more likely to be shared.

Timing matters. Publishing when your audience is most active increases initial engagement, which platforms reward with greater reach.

Relatability creates connection. Content that reflects shared experiences or addresses common pain points resonates deeply with audiences.

The surprise element captures attention. Unexpected twists, novel perspectives, or unique presentations stand out in crowded feeds.`,
