# TF-Locoformer Pretrained Weights

This directory stores pretrained model weights for TF-Locoformer inference.

## Expected Files

- `tf-locoformer-medium.bin` - Free tier model (2 stems: vocals, instrumental)
- `tf-locoformer-pro.bin` - Pro tier model (5 stems: vocals, drums, bass, instruments, fx)

## Weight File Format

Weight files should be in binary format containing:
1. Metadata (JSON header)
2. Model weights (Float32Array serialized)

See `lib/audio-processing/utils/weight-loader.ts` for the expected structure.

## If Weights Are Missing

The system will automatically:
1. Log a warning
2. Use randomly initialized weights (not recommended for production)
3. Continue operation (useful for development/testing)

## Obtaining Weights

To use pretrained weights:
1. Train TF-Locoformer on your dataset, or
2. Obtain pretrained weights from model providers
3. Serialize to the expected binary format
4. Place in this directory
5. Restart the server

## Note

Weight files are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`) due to their size.
You may want to store them in cloud storage (S3, GCS) for production deployments.
