## Granular Effects

Break audio into small grains and manipulate them.

### Basic Granular Texture (🟢 Basic)

**Description**: Simple grain-based texture  
**Use Case**: Pads, ambient textures, sound design  
**Quality**: Cloudy, ethereal texture

**FFmpeg Command:**
```bash
# Simulate granular with very short delays
ffmpeg -i input.wav -af "\
aecho=0.5:0.4:20:0.3,\
aecho=0.5:0.4:40:0.3,\
aecho=0.5:0.4:60:0.3,\
aecho=0.5:0.4:80:0.3" output.wav
```

**Pedalboard (Python):**
```python
from pedalboard import Pedalboard, Delay
from pedalboard.io import AudioFile

# Simulate granular with very short delays
board = Pedalboard([
    Delay(delay_seconds=0.02, feedback=0.3, mix=0.5),
    Delay(delay_seconds=0.04, feedback=0.3, mix=0.5),
    Delay(delay_seconds=0.06, feedback=0.3, mix=0.5),
    Delay(delay_seconds=0.08, feedback=0.3, mix=0.5)
])

with AudioFile('input.wav') as f:
    audio = f.read(f.frames)
    samplerate = f.samplerate

effected = board(audio, samplerate)

with AudioFile('output.wav', 'w', samplerate, effected.shape[0]) as f:
    f.write(effected)
```

**Parameters Explained (Pedalboard):**
- `delay_seconds`: Very short delays (0.02-0.08s = 20-80ms)
- `feedback=0.3`: Low feedback for texture

    f.write(effected)
```

**Parameters Explained (Pedalboard):**

### When to Use Each Tool

**Use FFmpeg when:**
- Working with video and audio together
- Need complex filter routing
- Already using FFmpeg in your pipeline
- Batch processing with format conversion

**Use SoX when:**
- Pure audio command-line workflow
- Quick one-off processing tasks
- Shell scripting audio pipelines
- Need fast, reliable audio manipulation

**Use Pedalboard when:**
- Building custom effects or processing chains
- Integrating audio with Python workflows
- Need algorithmic or generative processing
- Want programmatic control over parameters
- Building audio applications or plugins
- Working with machine learning/AI audio projects

### Output Quality Notes

**Reverse Effects:**
- All three tools produce identical results for simple reversal
- No quality differences for pure reverse operations
- Pedalboard offers more control for complex reverse chains

**Granular Effects:**
- FFmpeg simulates with delays (good approximation)
- SoX provides better granular-like textures
- Pedalboard allows true algorithmic granular synthesis with full control

**Creative Gating:**
- FFmpeg's tremolo is fast and effective
- SoX provides flexible gating options
- Pedalboard offers precise, sample-accurate control
- Pedalboard best for tempo-synced, complex patterns

### Recommendation by Skill Level

**🟢 Basic Users:**
- Start with **SoX** for simplicity
- Use **FFmpeg** if you need video support

**🟡 Intermediate Users:**
- Use **SoX** or **FFmpeg** based on workflow
- Learn **Pedalboard** for custom effects

**🔴 Advanced Users:**
- Use **Pedalboard** for maximum control
- Combine all three tools in complex pipelines
- Use each tool's strengths for different stages

## Common Applications

### Transition Effect
```bash
# Reverse reverb into glitch
sox input.wav - reverse | \
sox - - reverb 70 80 100 100 0 0 | \
sox - reversed.wav reverse
ffmpeg -i reversed.wav -af "tremolo=f=16:d=0.9" transition.wav
```

### Riser/Build-Up
```bash
# Reverse + pitch shift + reverb
sox input.wav - reverse | \
rubberband -p 12 - pitched.wav
sox pitched.wav riser.wav reverb 80 90 100 100 0 0
```

### Ambient Pad
```bash
# Extreme stretch + reverb
rubberband -t 8.0 --pitch-hq input.wav stretched.wav
sox stretched.wav pad.wav reverb 90 85 100 100 0 0
```

### Glitch Hit
```bash
# Bit crush + reverse + stutter
sox input.wav -b 8 temp.wav reverse
sox temp.wav glitch.wav trim 0 0.125 repeat 4
```

## Creative Effect Ideas

### Textural Ideas
- Freeze audio with extreme time stretch
- Layer multiple reversed versions
- Create drones from any sound
- Granular clouds from percussion
- Convolution with unusual impulses

### Rhythmic Ideas
- Gate with drum triggers
- Stutter at tempo subdivisions
- Rhythmic pitch shifting
- Polyrhythmic delays
- Tempo-synced glitches

### Timbral Ideas
- Extreme formant shifting
- Ring modulation vocals
- Convolution through metal
- Bit crush + saturation
- Frequency shifting

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Too chaotic, unmusical  
**Solution**: Use tempo-synced effects, musical intervals, less extreme settings

**Problem**: Loses original character  
**Solution**: Parallel processing, blend with dry signal

**Problem**: Not interesting enough  
**Solution**: Layer multiple effects, automate parameters

**Problem**: Too obvious/cheesy  
**Solution**: Subtle application, use for moments not throughout

---

**Final Thoughts:**

Creative effects are about exploration and experimentation. Don't be afraid to:
- Try unusual combinations
- Break conventional rules
- Make happy accidents
- Push parameters to extremes
- Create your own techniques

The best creative effects serve the music and add interest without overwhelming the mix.
